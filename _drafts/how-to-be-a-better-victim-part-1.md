*Life is out of control.*

*There is no way out.*

*It's hopeless.*

Do you get these intrusive thoughts during stressful times, too? You know, those times where it feels like God is personally placing burden upon burden on your shoulders and watching indifferently as you struggle? You may feel this way right now. It's almost reasonable to believe that your life is resigned to God's fickle whims. Bad things just keep happening, and you can't find God's light in the darkness.

It's easy for us to fall into ruts of depression and anxiety when we feel that we don't have a smidgen of control of our own lives. God doesn't want us to live in these pits of despair. He gave His creation a tool to navigate tough circumstances.

He gave us the power to make choices.

The **POWER**. To make **CHOICES**. When you think about the connotations of the words *power* and *choice*, another word surfaces. **FREEDOM**. Free people have power. Free people are allowed to make choices. We are free, even when we feel we are a slave to cruel circumstances.

Victim mentality is one of those inner demons that can make us forget our responsibilities for the consequences in our lives. It blurs the lines of our boundaries, so we can't be honest with ourselves that some hardships we face are the result of our own doing. When we can properly separate what we are reaping from what circumstances that are not our fault, we realize that we have more control than we think.

Owning the choices we've made is not easy by any means, but it's an exercise that can free us from helplessness. We do have the power to influence our lives. We do have the right to make choices and avoid situations that will get us into trouble. Not ready to face every bad decision you've made in your life? That's alright. Start small. Get in the habit of recognizing the consequences of the decisions you make in your everyday life.

*I feel sluggish, because I chose not to make breakfast a priority this morning.*

*I don't get to have free time to myself tonight, because I took on too many commitments today.*

The more you commit to recognizing and accepting your influence on your own life, the easier it will be to assign blame appropriately for undesirable or bad situations.

But what happens when we take too much responsibility? Are we to blame for other people's actions toward us? In How to Be a Better Victim Part 2, we'll talk about another dangerous inner demon--victim blaming. And what if no one can be blamed for our problems? How are we in control when we are actual victims of injustice? In Part 3, we'll wrap up this series with understanding our responsibilities when we are true victims.
