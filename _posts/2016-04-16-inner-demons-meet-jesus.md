We're not exactly prepared for what happens in our lives when we accept Christ as our Savior. We see the humble, the happy, and the God-fearing emanate the Holy Spirit, and we want to have what they have. We think being baptized will give us joy, peace, and rich faith. And then...

...nothing changes.

Or...

life gets even harder.

There are trials. Confusion. Pain. Our greatest fears are thrown in our faces. We're tempted to curse God and write Return to Sender on our gift of salvation.

What happened? Weren't we promised bliss, closeness to our Creator, and a softened heart? Now, we're miserable, God is nowhere to be found, and our hearts are so hard that following Christ has become a chore.

>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. (ESV, Romans 6:3-4)

When we come to God as we are, we are giving ourselves to Him and essentially saying, "Here, take this brokenness and restore." What we really want to add is, "But! But, leave those bits of me alone. I like those bits. I wanna keep those bits. K, thanks!"

*Those* bits. Those fears, those idols, those traditions, those people, those sins that we would give anything not to have exposed, challenged, or taken away. Those bits. Those...*inner demons*. If they stand in the way of serving God, those inner demons will be attacked. We can't surrender to God when darkness has a hold on us. When we resist letting God purge that darkness from our life, we are locked in a struggle between those two opposing forces, and it's up to us to make a choice which side we yield to.

We don't have to fight these inner demons on our own. God does most of the work for us, but we have to introduce these demons to the Lord. Jesus is ready to meet them, and He is ready to pluck us out of their grasp. Ready to make that introduction?
