>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him would not perish but have eternal life. (ESV, John 3:16)

For God so loved the world...

The world. Those two words can make us as individuals feel completely removed from this special world that God loves. The world means *other* people, right? It means Christians and non-believers. It means the righteous and criminals. It means the poorest of the poor and richest of the rich. It's says the world. It doesn't say "For God so loved you."

Do you sometimes forget that you are a part of this world God loves? He doesn't draw a hard line through Earth and say, "These people are ok. But those people over there need to shape up if they want salvation and love."

He loves all of us, unconditionally, to the point of sacrifice. Every last one of us. That includes you. You. With all your mistakes and your flaws, with all your horrible thoughts and selfish ambitions. Can you imagine that someone who knows the worst things about you would still hang on a cross for *you*? Your God did that. Not just for the world, not just for other people. But for you.

That's how much we are worth to God. Once we start accepting that we are loved that much, we'll fight for ourselves as the Lord has fought for us.

Look in the mirror and tell yourself, "I am worth it." Repeat it. For an hour. For days. For weeks. As long as it takes for you to believe it. Ignore the voices that give you reasons why you are not worthy of His unconditional love. God knows those reasons and sacrificed for you anyway. How are you going to move forward from now? Are you going to believe you are worthy enough to abandon your inner demons? Or will you still believe you don't deserve a better life?
