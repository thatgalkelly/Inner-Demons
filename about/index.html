It’s not like we don’t want to align our will with God’s. It’s just that we might back out when the process of reshaping and surrendering involves sacrificing things we don’t want to let go of. Those things. Those habits. Those people. Those traditions. Those sins. Those painful memories. Those anxieties. Those inner demons. This is for those of us who want to serve God but are terrified of taking that next step of letting God work within us.</p> <p><strong>What do you mean by “inner demons”?</strong></p> <p>I mean circumstances that hold us back from serving God. Like anxiety. Illness. A dysfunctional upbringing. Vices. Self-serving goals. Toxic relationships. Traumatic past experiences. Rage. Depression. Addictions and obsessions. Idols.</p> <p><strong>What does it mean to introduce my inner demons to Jesus?</strong></p> <p>It means laying our fear, sin, and pain at the cross where it belongs. It means handing over everything that breaks our spirit to Jesus and having someone bigger than ourselves fight our battles. It means no longer resisting God’s will for our lives, and allowing Him to make the necessary changes in us. It’s surrendering, and it’s a gift in exchange for our demons. Ultimately, it’s a fulfilling life and a close walk with God.</p> <p><strong>What does surrendering look like?</strong></p> <p>Surrendering is understanding God’s character, so we can better put our trust in His plans for us. It’s dumping toxic behaviors and adopting new ways to live and interact with other people. It’s learning about how to let go in order to gain.
